Inverter:
=========
- Converts DC to AC
- Types: 
  ------
    1) entirely electronic 
    2) mechanical(rotary components) plus some electronic components
- Device converting AC to DC is called a rectifier.

Different types of batteries:
=============================
- Lead acid batteries - cheap
- Lithium ion  
- Lithium iron phospate(LiFePO4) batteries
    - safer, works in lower temperatures
    -    works with 12V
- LiFeYPO4 (Y stands for Yttrium which is in the cathode)
    - op temp -(minus) 45 degree celcius to 85 degress .i.e., works in cold weather

Safety instructions for Lithium ion batteries:
==============================================
- Don't overcharge
- Don't overdischarge - low voltage disconnect
- Don't charge in cold temps

Basic componests of the powerwall:
=================================
1) Batteries
2) Battery management system (BMS) - at a min should provide overvoltage, undervoltage and overcurrent protections
3) Inverter (if you want to supply to AC power to the sockets) - not required if you are going to use DC directly
4) Cooling system

Solar power setup:
=================
* Maximum Power Point Tracking(MPPT) Solar Charge Controllers
